# Brownfield Of Dreams

This is a brownfield project used at Turing for Backend Mod 3.
The base repo, along with the Spec and Evaluation Rubric can be found here:
https://github.com/turingschool-examples/brownfield-of-dreams

### About the Project

This is a Ruby on Rails application used to organize YouTube content used for online learning. Each tutorial is a playlist of video segments. Within the application an admin is able to create tags for each tutorial in the database. A visitor or registered user can then filter tutorials based on these tags.

A visitor is able to see all of the content on the application but in order to bookmark a segment they will need to register. Once registered a user can bookmark any of the segments in a tutorial page.

## Local Setup

First you'll need to setup an API key with YouTube and have it defined within `ENV['YOUTUBE_API_KEY']`. There will be one failing spec if you don't have this set up.

```
$ git clone
```

Install the gem packages
```
$ bundle install
```

Install figaro
```
$ figaro install
```

Install node packages for stimulus
```
$ brew install node
$ brew install yarn
$ yarn add stimulus
```

Set up the database
```

$ rake db:migrate
$ rake db:seed
```

Run the test suite:
